          <p>Team $300, Individual $100</p>
          <p>
A project that either creatively or impressively uses hardware as the primary means to provide a service, solve a problem, or facilitate some other abstract creation/interaction. It is possible that a hardware project uses some software for controlling logic, but the primary sophistication lies within the composition or production of the physical components of the project.
          </p>
          <p><b>Examples:</b> Interactive art, wearable electronics, 3D printed designs, robotic automation, sensor based systems, mechanical logic systems<p>

          <h2>Best Software Project</h2>
          <p>Team $300, Individual $100</p>
          <p>
A project that either creatively or impressively uses software as the primary means to provide a service, solve a problem, or facilitate some other abstract creation/interaction. It is possible that a software project uses some physical hardware for interaction, but the primary sophistication lies within the composition of the algorithms, tools, or libraries used by the software.
          </p>
          <p><b>Examples:</b> Games, apps, interactive art, APIs, tools, libraries, visualizations<p>

          <h2>Audience Favorite</h2>
          <p>$200</p>
          <p>
The point of this award is to allow fellow competitors to judge and vote on which project they think deserves recognition and need not specifically be a hardware or software project.  Voting tickets will be handed out to all audience members when presentations start and competitors are encouraged to bring friends and family to help vote in their favor.
